*** Limitation
- Calculations of electronic polarization (not topological characterization) are restricted to cases when the lattice vectors are aligned with to cartesian directions. For example, the zinc-blend or NaCl structures should be regarded as an 8 atom cell instead of the conventional 2 atom basis. This restriction is partly lifted (see - [[https://github.com/spichardo/BerryPI/wiki/Tutorial:-Non-orthogonal-lattice-vectors][Tutorial 3]]).
